# LTR2B_gRNA
This repository contains an incomplete version of the work done for my master's dissertation on Developing an sgRNA Design Tool for Epigenetic Editing of Genomic Repeats. While this repository includes some of the critical components, it does not contain all the analysis and code used throughout the thesis. However, the files provided here include the full and complete files referenced in the paper.

Please note that some general components and important features, such as certain code snippets and tools like Bowtie2, are not included in this repository.
